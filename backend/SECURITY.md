# API security notes

## Authentication

- **Staff users** sign in with email and password verified against `users.password_hash` (bcrypt). Sessions use the `hr_token` HttpOnly cookie (or `Authorization: Bearer` for scripts). HR and admin users can access recruitment routes; finance users are restricted to membership-payment review routes.
- **Applicants** use email + application code + OTP. OTP codes are HMAC-hashed before storage; they are not stored in plaintext.
- HR JWT lifetime defaults to 8 hours (`JWT_EXPIRES_IN`). Applicant sessions default to 1 hour.

Integration tests require `DATABASE_URL` to point at a dedicated database whose name matches
`/(^|[_-])test([_-]|$)/`, such as `aws_ust_recruitment_test`; `testdb` does not match.

## Public endpoints (no HR/applicant session)

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|
| GET | `/health` | Liveness |
| GET | `/positions` | Open positions only (`isOpen=true`) |
| GET | `/positions/:id/interview-slots` | Slot times and occupancy only |
| GET | `/recruitment-window` | Window bounds |
| GET | `/interview-window` | Interview window bounds |
| POST | `/applications` | Apply flow (Zod-validated) |
| POST | `/uploads/presign` | Upload session (throttled at API Gateway) |
| POST | `/applicant-auth/*` | OTP request/verify/logout |
| POST | `/auth/login` | HR login |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Clears HR cookie |

## Membership payments

- Applicant payment routes require the existing Application ID + email OTP session.
- Receipt uploads are private S3 objects with exact size, checksum, MIME, and file-signature validation.
- Official payment QR uploads use the same private S3 bucket, validate exact upload metadata and image signatures, and are exposed to applicants only through short-lived signed download URLs.
- HR and admin users manage payment-period dates, group-chat links, opening/closing, and invitation delivery. Finance and admin users manage the amount and official accounts, and may verify or reject receipts.
- HR and admins may retry failed payment invitations. Verified members get one email with their Member ID, and their group links appear on the applicant dashboard. Only admins may reverse a verification. HR and Finance may both view payment records and export verified members.
- A submitted receipt remains pending until manual verification. Member IDs are allocated only on verification and are retained when a verification is reversed so IDs are never reused. Executive Board members and directors pay through the same flow as everyone else, as `officer` applications that R101's lists, counts and results never read. The officer hunt runs beside R101 with its own track on applications, positions and interview slots, so each round only lists, books and releases its own, and a seat's unique key per term stops two holders for one board or director seat. Their numbers are fixed by seat, and advisers hold 9001–9003 from the day they are seeded; the general pool stops at 8999 so it never hands those out.

`GET /positions?scope=all` requires HR authentication and returns closed roles for admin UI.

## CSRF / cross-origin writes

Mutating requests (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) require an `Origin` or `Referer` host that matches `CORS_ORIGIN` / `APP_BASE_URL` (localhost allowed in non-production). This complements `SameSite=Lax` cookies.

## Deferred (not implemented here)

- Postgres row-level security and a limited DB role
- CAPTCHA on apply / presign / OTP
- Hono app-level IP rate limits (API Gateway throttling and OTP DB limits remain)

## Dependencies

`pnpm audit` is run at release time. Dev-only `esbuild` findings under `drizzle-kit` are pinned via `esbuild: "^0.25.0"` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` overrides.
